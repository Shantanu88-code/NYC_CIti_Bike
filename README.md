# NYC_CIti_Bike

# Analysis Overview

Our friend and Kate have though about starting a bikesharing business which they came across when they visited New York City. They were intrigued by the idea and though about a similar startup in Des Moines. They need investors. For that purpose, Kate gathered bike sharing data for NYC for August 2019. They have to consider few things from data as both cities and traffic is different. Using different visualizations and required data, they have come up with some graphs and heatmap to present to investors whether this investment will be fruitful or not. 

# Results

This graph shows the length of time the bikes have been checked out by all riders with 0 - 15 minutes being highest at 12AM.

The next graph shows the checkout time length but as per different genders, Males, Females and Undisclosed. It is seen that most of users have been Males followed by females.

The next heatmap shows total number of trips through out the week with hour of start and stoptime. It can be seen that most number of bikes are used during weekdays, between 7 am - 9 am and then 5 pm - 7 pm and especially highest on Thursday. So, they can assume, people mostly use it for commute purpose, keeping in mind standard office hours.

This heatmap elaborates by further providing information about number of trips through out the week, per genders. It is seen again that most number of bikes are used between weekdays and around same time (as mentioned above). The highest number of users are Males, around three times more than Female users, when compared same start and stop times.

The next visualzation shows the type of users, whether Subscribed or just Customers. It can be seen that majority of users are Subscibers which is very good. There are more number of Subscribed female riders thoughout the week than one-off customers. And for males, there is a massive difference between user types, e.g. for thursday, there are 21,034 customers and a whopping 259,316 subscribers. It shows it in demand and sustainable.

The following bar graph shows the number of bikes that are used thoughout the day. It gives a glimpse of hours from 12 am - 11 pm. As it is seen earlier, 7 am - 9 am and then 5 pm - 7pm are the hours where highest number of bikes are used. From 1 am - 5 am, there is a minimum usage. This is where maintenance can take place.

The following map shows the top starting locations in the NYC. It is seen those locations are quite close to each other meaning, it is either highly densed area or there are a lot of visitors who use bikes to explore areas.

This is a supporting bar graph that shows number of bikes used per gender with Male being significantly highest.

# Summary:

To summarize, it is safe to say that it will be a sustainable venture and safe to invest. The visualization will definitely impress investors as we see significant amout of users. Also, there is a majority of subscried users which provides a lot of stability and good source of profit. But again, this was for NYC and they are thinking to start the venture in Des Moines. There are a lot of differences of geography, traffic, loactions, population etc which they have to take into consideration. 
With given dataset, we would perform further analysis to get more specific information. For example, we can create a map that shows top starting or ending locations as per hours of the day to figure out which locations are mostly used through out different hours of the day. Another would be adding a trip duration to the map that shows locations with total minutes of bikes usage.
